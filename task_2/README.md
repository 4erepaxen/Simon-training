# Make homework

Determine the sorting time spent by each of the algorithms for sorting the array.
Implement each of the algorithms as a separate function.

* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort

Fill the array with random characters (a-z, A-Z). Organize filling as a separate
function. Write the result to a file.
Functions:
* Sorting (3pcs)
* Array filling functions:
    * Random numbers
    * Reading from a file
* Writing to a file

The program should include a dialogue with the user. The maintenance of each
variable should have an order with an explanation of the format (limitations) of
the data to be entered; presence of a check for compliance with the declared format
(so-called "foolproof") and checking for invalid values (which can lead to
calculation errors).

Create a makefile to build and clean the project.

P.S. It is better to have each module in individual folder.
